Project Motivation

This project is initiated by Udacity for Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. The main focus of this is finding answers to respective questions: 

1. “What are the most common amenities in the listings?” 
2. "What attracts the guests most for renting a property?" 
3. “What are the most influencial features of the dataset to estimate the price of a listing?”
